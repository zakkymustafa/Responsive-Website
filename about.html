	<p>It all started with a dream, a vision, a purpose: to meet modest women’s desire to wear the clothes that fit the life and times they live in.

Abayacollection1.com launched on Mother’s Day, 2011.We were the first Turkish fashion platform to deliver online clothes shopping to our target audience in such variety. Born in Istanbul, we now have customers in 130 countries. We offer contents in five languages: Turkish, Arabic, English, French, and German. We speak our customers’ language, we recognize their needs, and we know their preferences. Each month, we reach 16 million visitors from all over the world via our app and desktop platforms. We sell over 650 brands and 70 thousand products, shipping thousands of packages a day to five continents. We employ confident and youthful staff from different nationalities and cultures whose average age is 28.

We are the co-creator of the Modest Fashion Week concept, which made its debut in Istanbul in 2016 and has gone on to be staged in London (2017), Dubai (2017) and Jakarta (2018).

The passion and dedication towards our work has rewarded us with our customer's love and trust beyond imagination. In 2016, Reuters selected us as the world's most popular Islamic apparel website.In November of 2017, we won the prestigious “Islamic Economy Award” in the Islamic Arts category. Then in March of 2018 we earned the “International Business Excellence” award for elevating local vendors onto a global platform and making them global retailers.

As Turkey’s first international online shopping site platform and e-export champion, we are proud to introduce small producers and designers to the world. We may be growing fast, but we still adhere to our start-up ethos.</p>
